## What is a Vulnerability?

A vulnerability is an exploit in the software which can be used to gain unauthorized access to resources that are not granted to users via normal means, or create lasting and permanent damage on the host machine.

Please note that crashes are not considered a vulnerability that needs to be reported through this process. Please report them using the standard issue reporting process.

## Supported Versions

The wireteam only supports the github master branch, the latest release, and the Steam workshop. Versions other than this are unsupported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability to one of the administrators, moderators, or developers on the wiremod discord.
