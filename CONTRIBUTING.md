# I need help with an E2 or other wiremod entity

The issues section of this repository is used to report bugs with wiremod, not for asking for help. If you would like to recieve help with how to use wiremod, you can ask on the subreddit or on discord. Note that the discord channel is far more active, and if you ask on the subreddit, expect to wait a few days for an answer.
